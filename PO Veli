PrimaryRole:	Creating a GUIMockup
Describtion:
At first I had to lookup, what a Mockup is in the first Place.
After having a rough understanding of my task, I did some first drafts.
But during that, I bumped into my first problem, "What should it look like in the first place?".
Thanks to some research and looking at some example, I got some rudementery Idee how it could look like.
And I finished my first mayor task swiftly.
